Think of a pain point your target audience has. the more common it is, the better. for example, “stop getting distracted by your phone”

Then give a piece of advice or lesson that solves the pain you stated above

Dont

Do

The first line addresses this misconception.

In the second line, the "truth" is revealed.

### You don’t need  you need

### Life hack: \[insert tip or trick here]. \[insert brief explanation or benefit]. #lifehack

\#unspokentruth

### Question your audience

What’s your favorite book/movie/TV show at the moment?

What’s your opinion on \[current event/app/trend]?

They save people time, effort, and money
